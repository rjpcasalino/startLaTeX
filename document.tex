I am a dyslexic, Brooklyn born---Brooklyn, that somber city---and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style and will make the record in my own way: I am a learning disabled computer programmer that wants to grow and learn everyday and help whomever seeks help from me and to do good deeds with the time left that I have. That's why I am writing this personal statement and that's why I'm applying to the PMP.

Here I am thinking out loud onto a terminal that might become a page IRL. What I know is the cathode-ray tube of my youth has become a flat screen but it's all still the same. Nothing ends just begins again. What comes next for me? I've made it to being able to write with \LaTeX\ and I've taught myself how to read computer programs and scripts but something is lacking besides a Computer Science degree. Something I can't get from reading Knuth or even Kernighan alone. Something I can't get from OpenBSD manual pages. Something, something...

My professional life begins in Chicago. I was designated an IT "Power User" for the Chicago region at American Apparel before it went bankrupt. I helped HQ debug point of sale system failures and fixed store servers when they went bust or needed software patches. When I moved away from Chicago and to New Orleans my IT experienced served me well and I was able to land a job at a charter school managing its IT infrastructure and helping its teachers and students with all their IT issues. Managing fleets of Chromebooks and ensuring internet access for all. Taking a step back, I had begun programming when I was ten years old but became convinced without evidence that beyond HTML  all other languages were writing ones and zeroes. All binary and I'm no good at math. Anyway, during my last year at the charter school in New Orleans I discovered that programming was indeed my passion and nothing to fear. I began to learn the rudiments of the Python programming language. These were challenging times for me as my job was ending and another major move was afoot because I had fallen in love. My future wife was moving to Atlanta to gain an MBA and she convinced me to better myself and apply to a coding boot camp. I did and I was able to gain employment as a programmer before the boot camp ended.

I remember my first programming interview and how terrified I was. I had known that ``white boarding'' was in store but I was lucky enough to be interviewed by someone that just wanted pair program and debug an issue together. I still bombed it but was lucky this person was kind and saw that I was, indeed, a programmer. He told me to go home and try again and see what I could come up with. I did and landed my first job as a ``Software Engineer''. It felt like a dream moving from one scene to the next in quick succession.
