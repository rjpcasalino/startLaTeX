I've been assembling computers since my teen years. I am well acquainted with peripherals (serial communication interfaces, GPIO, et al) and tinker with SoC devices regularly. I enjoy keeping older computers running and learned to configure a custom DHCP server (using OpenBSD) on an old Sun Ultra 10.\hfill \break

I attended a ``coding'' boot camp in summer of 2015 which focused on Ruby on Rails and Node.js.

I've also earned a ``Master the Mainframe'' certificate in May of 2020 from IBM which has demonstrated my extensive programming skills and I am able to develop application tasks (C, JAVA, COBOL, assembler and REXX) on the z/OS platform. I've also obtained a Hurricane Electric IPv6 Certificate to demonstrate my ability to configure IPv6.\hfill \break

THEORY AND ALGORITHMS
