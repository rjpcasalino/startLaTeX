\addblocktext{Summary}{%
I am an American, Brooklyn born — Brooklyn, that somber city — and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style and will make the record in my own way.
I am a lover of UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux and OpenBSD. I strive to write clean code, understand systems, and above all else, help people. I can help manage hidden complexity.

    \explanation{Junior Software Programmer}
    \indent \indent \begin{minipage}{0.96\linewidth} \footnotesize
     At Liaison I wrote and maintained a NodeJS RESTful API using the HapiJS framework. This API was used in conjunction with a user-friendly AngularJS based frontend for a "Big Data" platform named "Alloy". Working on a cross-functional team that spanned oceans we produced an MVP in an agile environment and delivered the MVP within two months. Afterward, I was responsible for maintenance of the application's frontend and backend systems. This maintenance included regular software updates and patches.

     While with Merchant-e I delivered a NodeJS database connection cli for an Oracle database to replace an aging and arcane Java-based solution. At the same time, I supported Apache and nginx server upgrades and maintenance for a variety of frontend applications ranging from the POS UI to the company's marketing website. I was also able to mentor junior developers.

     During this time I first worked for "GawkBox" — a company devoted to monetizing online streamer's content (Twitch and YouTube et al). I owned the rewrite of their authentication API using Go to replace a hastily written NodeJS API. I introduced VueJS for version 2 of their frontend replacing a poorly supported Sails.js application. I was able to enhance the login/authentication experience for users of the "GawkBox" platform while fulfilling new feature requests from the product team. \\ Next, I worked for "React Mobile" overseeing the queue system for the company's "Panic Button" solution ensuring both uptime and availability. I supported an Electron based frontend that allowed users of the service to remotely manage wireless beacons.

     Working at Sinch I supported the creation of personalized SMS and RCS messages written with Ruby scripts and glued together with Bash driving Adobe AfterEffects. I was also tasked with maintaining the content management system and documenting arcane processes.

     At Ad Hoc I own and maintain the Medicare.gov Plan Finder application and oversee both plan and drug data ETL processes. I also provide support for the authentication experience for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. At the same time, I maintain Plan Finder's AWS Infrastructure using Terraform and write documentation for Plan Finder's internal documentation website. I help support the company's internal recruiting tool ("People App") fulfilling feature development and maintenance requests. Finally, I've created cli tools for internal operations to make the jobs of both Software Engineers and Product Managers easier. These cli tools allow for connection to government VPN and allow stakeholders to query databases securely, query the status of our systems in general, and perform AWS operations.
