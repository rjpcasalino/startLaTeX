% Summary
\addblocktext{Summary}{%
I am a dyslexic, Brooklyn born—Brooklyn, that somber city—and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style and will make the record in my own way while keeping it real and true.
I am in love with UNIX-like operating systems NixOS and OpenBSD. I strive to write clean code, understand systems, and above all else, help people.

     to meet their toughest data challenges while building a robust data-centric foundation.}}}\\
    \explanation{Software Programmer}
    \indent \indent \begin{minipage}{0.96\linewidth} \footnotesize
     At Liaison I wrote and maintained a Node.js RESTful API using the Hapi.js framework. This API was used in conjunction with a user-friendly AngularJS based front end for a "Big Data" platform named "Alloy". Working on a cross-functional team that spanned oceans we produced an MVP in an agile environment and delivered the MVP within two months. Afterward, I was responsible for maintenance of the application's front end and back end systems. This maintenance included regular software updates and patches.

     While with Merchant-e I delivered a Node.js database connection tool for an Oracle database to replace an aging and arcane Java-based solution. At the same time, I supported Apache and nginx server upgrades and maintenance for a variety of front end applications ranging from the POS UI to the company's marketing website. I was also able to mentor junior developers and help them with their projects. Finally, I was able to introduce the company to the benefits of using Docker for development and production environments.

     During this time I first worked at "GawkBox"—a startup whose mission was to help monetize streamer's content (Twitch, YouTube, Mixer et al). I owned the rewrite of their authentication API replacing a hastily written Node.js API with Go resulting in reduced code complexity. I also stood up a MySQL DB to work in conjunction with this API. I introduced Vue.js for version 2 of their front end replacing a poorly supported Sails.js implementation. I was able to enhance the login/authentication experience for users of the "GawkBox" platform while fulfilling new feature requests from product team. Next, I worked for "React Mobile" overseeing the Ruby based queue system for the company's "Panic Button" solution ensuring both uptime and availability. I supported an Electron based front end that allowed users of the service to remotely manage their wireless beacons.

     Working at Sinch I supported the creation of personalized SMS and RCS messages written with Ruby scripts and glued together with Bash driving Adobe After Effects. I maintained the content management system and documented arcane processes within system.

     At Ad Hoc help maintain and ship new features for the Medicare.gov Plan Finder application. This work includes owning portions of both plan and drug data ETL processes which involves myriad scripts written in three different languages. I also provide support for the authentication experience for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. I assist in maintaining Plan Finder's IaC using Terraform and write documentation for Plan Finder's internal documentation website. I help support the company's internal recruiting tool ("People App") fulfilling feature development and maintenance requests. Finally, I've created cli tools for internal operations to make the jobs of both Software Engineers and Product Managers easier. These cli tools allow for connection to government VPN and allow stakeholders to query databases securely, query the status of our systems in general, and perform various cloud operations.
